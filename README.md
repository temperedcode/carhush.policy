Welcome to CarHush ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, CarHush (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

This policy applies to both the LITE and PRO versions of the Application.

## 2. Data Controller

The party responsible for processing your personal data (the "Data Controller") is:

*   **Name:** Tempered Code
*   **Address:** Poland, Józefów 9
*   **Email:** temperedcode.dev@gmail.com

## 3. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### A. Information You Provide Directly to Us

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account using Google Sign-In, we access your basic profile information, such as your name, email address, and profile picture. You can also set a custom display name and a short biography in your CarHush profile, which is stored in our database.
*   **Vehicle Information:** We collect detailed information about the vehicles you add to your garage, including make, model, production year, VIN (optional), body type, fuel type, engine details, power, drivetrain, and tire information.
*   **Soundproofing Modifications:** We store the details of any soundproofing modifications you document, including the car part, materials used, and any notes you provide.
*   **User Content:** We collect information you provide when you post comments, replies, or report content within the community features.

### B. Information Collected Automatically During Measurements

*   **Acoustic Data:** We use your device's microphone to capture audio during a measurement session. This raw audio is processed in real-time on your device to calculate decibel levels (dB/dBA) and generate a frequency spectrum (FFT). The raw audio is not stored after the measurement is processed.
*   **Vibration Data:** We use your device's accelerometer and gyroscope to measure linear acceleration (vibrations) and to detect device movement that could invalidate a measurement.
*   **Speed Data:** We use your device's GPS to determine your vehicle's speed during a measurement session. Precise location data is not stored; only the resulting speed is used and saved.
*   **Noise Profiles:** To improve measurement accuracy, we may store a "noise profile" of your device's microphone, which is created during a calibration process in a quiet environment. This profile is stored only on your device.

### C. Information from Third Parties

We may receive information about you from your Google Account when you use Google Sign-In to log into the Application. This is limited to the basic profile information you have made available.

# Privacy Policy for CarHush

**Effective Date:** November 4, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to CarHush ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, CarHush (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

This policy applies to both the LITE and PRO versions of the Application.

## 2. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### A. Information You Provide Directly to Us

*   **Account Information:** When you create an account using Google Sign-In, we access your basic profile information, such as your name, email address, and profile picture. You can also set a custom display name and a short biography in your CarHush profile, which is stored in our database.
*   **Vehicle Information:** We collect detailed information about the vehicles you add to your garage, including make, model, production year, VIN (optional), body type, fuel type, engine details, power, drivetrain, and tire information.
*   **Soundproofing Modifications:** We store the details of any soundproofing modifications you document, including the car part, materials used, and any notes you provide.
*   **User Content:** We collect information you provide when you post comments, replies, or report content within the community features.

### B. Information Collected Automatically During Measurements

*   **Acoustic Data:** We use your device's microphone to capture audio during a measurement session. This raw audio is processed in real-time on your device to calculate decibel levels (dB/dBA) and generate a frequency spectrum (FFT). The raw audio is not stored after the measurement is processed.
*   **Vibration Data:** We use your device's accelerometer and gyroscope to measure linear acceleration (vibrations) and to detect device movement that could invalidate a measurement.
*   **Speed Data:** We use your device's GPS to determine your vehicle's speed during a measurement session. Precise location data is not stored; only the resulting speed is used and saved.
*   **Noise Profiles:** To improve measurement accuracy, we may store a "noise profile" of your device's microphone, which is created during a calibration process in a quiet environment. This profile is stored only on your device.

### C. Information from Third Parties

We may receive information about you from your Google Account when you use Google Sign-In to log into the Application. This is limited to the basic profile information you have made available.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we use information collected about you via the Application to:

*   Provide the core functionality of the Application, including measuring, analyzing, and storing noise and vibration data.
*   Create and manage your account.
*   Enable user-to-user communications and community features, such as sharing measurements, leaderboards, comments, and user profiles.
*   Provide a backup and restore feature for your data using your personal Google Drive account.
*   Personalize and improve your user experience.
*   Respond to your support requests and resolve disputes.
*   Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the Application.
*   **[LITE Version Only]** Serve personalized or non-personalized advertisements through Google AdMob.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

### A. Publicly Shared Information (Community Features)

When you choose to share a measurement publicly, the following information becomes visible to all other users of the Application:
*   Your public display name and profile picture.
*   A snapshot of your vehicle's data at the time of the measurement (VIN is never shared).
*   The results of the measurement, including dB/dBA levels, vibration levels, CarHush Score, and analysis results.
*   Information about your soundproofing modifications.

Comments and replies you post are also public and are associated with your public display name.

### B. With Third-Party Service Providers

We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including:
*   **Google (Firebase & Google Cloud):** We use Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) to power our community features, store public data, and manage user accounts.
*   **Google (Google Drive API):** If you use the backup feature, we will access your Google Drive to store and retrieve a backup file in a private, application-specific folder that is not directly accessible by you or other applications. We do not have access to any other files on your Google Drive.
*   **Google (AdMob) [LITE Version Only]:** We use Google AdMob to display ads in the LITE version of the Application. AdMob may collect device identifiers and other data to serve relevant ads.

### C. By Law or to Protect Rights

We may disclose your information if we believe the release of information is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

Your private data (measurements, cars, and settings that you have not publicly shared) is stored locally on your device in a private database. Publicly shared data is stored on Google's Firebase Firestore servers. We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

*   **Access and Edit Your Information:** You can review and change your vehicle information, soundproofing modifications, and profile information at any time within the Application.
*   **Community Sharing:** You have full control over which measurements, if any, are shared publicly. You can choose not to participate in community features.
*   **Data Deletion:** You can delete individual cars, measurements, comments, and replies directly within the Application. To request the complete deletion of your account and all associated data from our servers, please contact us.
*   **Google Account:** You can revoke the Application's access to your Google Account at any time through your Google Account security settings.

## 7. Data Retention

We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services and to comply with our legal obligations. Data you have shared publicly may remain visible on the service even after you delete it from your local device.

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
